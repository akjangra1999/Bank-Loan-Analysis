# 🏦 Bank Loan Analysis Dashboard  

## 📌 Project Overview  

This project focuses on analyzing bank loan data to understand loan performance, customer behavior, repayment trends, and risk segmentation.  

Using **SQL, Python, and Power BI**, I transformed raw loan data into meaningful insights and built an interactive dashboard to help stakeholders make better financial decisions.

The dashboard highlights:
- Total Loan Applications  
- Funded vs Received Amount  
- Good vs Bad Loan Segmentation  
- Interest Rate & DTI Analysis  
- Loan Status Tracking  
- State-wise & Purpose-wise Distribution
